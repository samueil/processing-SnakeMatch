This variant of snake has to be played by two players on a keyboard (cursor-keys and W,A,S,D-keys)
It's the common principle to eat the randomly placed fruits for getting longer.
But there are some different rules:
- The snakes can't die, but may shrink back unto a size of one case.
- If the snake clashes in itself, it will cut there and the opponent-snake can pick up the cut off part and grow that way.
- If the snake clashes in its cut off parts or the opponent-snake, it will shrink until it changes the direction.
- The snakes can change the direction by hitting the opposite key of their current direction.

You'll see the game is neverending. But that's the key, you can play it just for fun with a friend and stop on a set time, hit SPACE and look, who has got bigger at this time.
